    Email has three parts: an envelope, a body, and a header. The envelope is pretty much exactly what it sounds like - what the email is sent in. The body is what is in the email (basically the message youâ€™re trying to send), and the header is like adding an address to the envelope. Emails are sent via the internet using a server. 

A domain name server, which is shortened to DNS, is something that keeps track of internet protocol, or the more commonly used abbreviation, IP, addresses attached to domain names. This makes domain names readable by machines like computers.
